# Penn-Collab-Project-1
## Description
```
As a developer I want to input profiles and criteria, then input data into each profile under said criteria(s); and track the frequency and development of each criteria, then plot the information to visually display trends for each profile. In addition, I want to log historic information and filter it based-upon the given week of the year, i.e. Jan. 1st to 7th is week 1; I also want to provide additional theory resources that will assist the user when developing profiles and criteria.
```

## APIs (Third-party)
```
What are we using?
https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/full-stack/v2.1/docs/track-events ←- Most use likely Stack exchange
Reddit API  ←-maybe use this one?
How are we using it?
Style?
Display information from reddit/ other API
Create a dashboard to view progress of workers
Function?
Track events and analyze them
Display and analyze the actions completed
External Information?
Subreddits (r/Labor) / other API info that can be used as references
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```
AS A DEVELOPER, I want a program that can log past and current activities of a worker to view and evaluate what tasks have been completed over time.
WHEN I input a name into the profile section
THEN I will view the worker’s current or past progress
I WANT to track the timeline of an activity and get real-time alerts when finished.
I WANT want to monetize the action by multiplying the time by hourly-rate.
WHEN I click the navbar
THEN the application is populated with information
WHEN I select a week in the past
THEN the past criteria and frequency of work is shown
I WANT a page with a function that displays the time relationship of data with a user profile as a graph
I WANT the graph to plot the trendline of a profile’s work and frequency
WHEN I click on another link 
THEN I am shown a third page that provides best practices and references
I WANT the current time and date to be pictured on the screen 
```

## First Task for each member 
```
Create HTML 
Style the CSS
Learn and implement the APIs
Create a graph with variables
```
